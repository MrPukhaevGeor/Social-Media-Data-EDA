# Social Media Data EDA 🚀

This is my playground for digging into messy social media data 🕵️‍♂️.  
I love taking chaotic, noisy datasets and turning them into something that actually makes sense — spotting patterns, trends, and stories hiding in the numbers 📊.  

Here I explore everything from post engagement and follower growth to sentiment analysis and viral trends. It’s raw, it’s exploratory, and it’s exactly how I like to work: experiment first, ask questions later 🤯.  

Expect messy charts, weird correlations, and aha moments. This isn’t polished research — it’s curiosity in action, a peek into how data tells its story when you actually dig deep.  

💡 **Tools I used:** Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter/Colab, a bit of trial and error, and a lot of coffee ☕.  

If you like seeing chaos slowly turn into insights, this is your corner of the internet.
